# Fraud Detection Dashboard

## Overview

The **Fraud Detection Dashboard** is a web application that visualizes and monitors fraud detection data in real time. It consists of a REST API built with Flask to serve fraud-related data and a dashboard interface built with Dash for interactive visualization. This application provides insights into transaction patterns, fraud distribution across devices and browsers, and fraud trends over time.
